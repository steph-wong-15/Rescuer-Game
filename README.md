## Running the game

To build the game, and run it, firstly download the entire project folder as a .zip file, which contains all the appropriate files (including the pom.xml file, which is needed for the proper version of javafx and required modules), and let Intelijj handle it after extracting the folder. After doing that, navigate to the filepath, `"\src\main\java\com\group1"`, just right click on and execute Main.java, which will build and run your game. It will open up the opening screen, and you'll see a button to click on to [play the game](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/499778411007574018/831379229470883840/unknown.png). In the file path, "\src\main\java\module-info.java", this should automatically require JavaFX modules `javafx.controls;` and `requires javafx.fxml; ` respectively. 


## Testing

Tests can all be run in **Intelijj**, by navigating to `"src/test/java/com/group1/Test.java"`, and then right-clicking on the respective class you want to see the tests for. 

For example, if I want to run ScoreTest, here is an [example.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/499778411007574018/831377806683930674/unknown.png) 

As you can see, all you have to do is right click on a file, and it will run all the appropriate tests corresponding to the class you selected.
